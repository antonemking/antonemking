#### What am I up to?

- 👨🏾‍🎓 Working on my masters at [Tufts](tufts.edu)
- 👨🏽‍💻 Trying to sell my DBaaS [mongrel.app](https:mongrel.app). If that does not work I will be open sourcing it
- 🧠 Learning as much as I can about DAOs. I think it is the most powerful use case for cryptocurrency.
- 🌱 Also, learning how to build Visual Studio Code extensions. I have an idea that I cannot wait to share.
- 📖 Lastly, I'm almost finished [Meditations](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B000FC1JAI&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GMS05HV9641QXKDJ37QG)


#### Bio

Transition to all my work to be open source.

Former soccer player, do not have much of an online presence but looking to chagne that as I plan to focus on open source projects. I hate hustle culter and do not see anything wrong with a 9-5. My work is extremely fulfilling, balanced and not looking to create the next facebook.
